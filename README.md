[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mthadley/elm-bp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mthadley/elm-bp)

My own minimal boiler plate for small [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) projects. Make
sure you have node and npm installed.

Building the project is handled by `make`:

```shell
$ make all test
$ open dist/index.html
```
